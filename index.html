			<p>
				I am a graduate student in computer science at Tampere University, where I mainly study topics of machine learning and math around it. In particular, I am interested in deep learning methods and computer vision.
			</p>
			<p>
				I maintain a blog on topics revolving around machine learning and related stuff. The blog posts are for me to consolidate my knowledge, and hopefully for some of you to get insights and have good reading experiences. To start this blog, I was inspired by people like <a href='https://gregorygundersen.com/blog' target='_blank'>Gregory Gundersen</a>, <a href='https://karpathy.ai/' target='_blank'>Andrej Karpathy</a> and <a href='https://colah.github.io/' target='_blank'>Christopher Olah</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Aside from computers and machine learning, I enjoy reading, music and sports. Especially ball games such as ice hockey and tennis are close to my heart. I am also particularly interested in electric vehicles and their technology.

The project involves heavy use of YOLOv4 algorithm, which gives the coordinates of the trucks and hazmat plates. The plates and truck detections are associated to detect dangerous goods, which are then tracked by DeepSORT/SORT.</div>
